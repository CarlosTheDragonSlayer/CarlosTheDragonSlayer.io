<h1> Calculator! </h1>
</head>
Asahel and I created an interactive calculator. You type in any math problem and get a solution. 
Building the calculator was very difficult and we had to do research on how we would create the calculator and how we would get the buttons to work along with the various features used in an everyday calculator.
